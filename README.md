# ðŸŽ¶ Arduino Mario Melody Player with Potentiometer & Button

This is a simple Arduino project that plays the Super Mario Bros. theme song using a piezo buzzer. The tempo (speed) of the melody can be adjusted with a potentiometer, and the melody starts playing only when a pushbutton is pressed.

## How It Works
- Power on Arduino uno to play the melody.
- Rotate the potentiometer to control the speed (tempo) of the melody.
- The buzzer plays notes by generating sound frequencies via the `tone()` function.
